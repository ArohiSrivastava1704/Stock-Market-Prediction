Stock Market Prediction Project


Overview
This project aims to predict stock prices using historical data and machine learning techniques. By analyzing trends, patterns, and key features, the project provides insights that can assist in making informed trading or investment decisions.

Project Objectives
Analyze historical stock market data to identify key patterns and trends.
Develop machine learning models to predict stock prices.
Evaluate the accuracy and reliability of predictions.
Provide visualizations for better interpretability of predictions and insights.
